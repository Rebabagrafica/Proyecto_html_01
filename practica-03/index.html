         <p>We, humans, have always believed in simplifying all the things and experiences we interact with, but in this process of simplifying we consciously/unconsciously have complicated our lives overall, well that’s a different discussion altogether, let’s keep it for some other story, coming back to simplifying experiences!</p>
         <p>So after simplifying a certain experience/process/interaction we further tend to refine that experience by making it pleasant, fruitful and delightful but it all starts with that process of simplifying and making sense out of every interaction/experience. This habit of human beings of simplifying experiences and making sense out of each one of them was closely studied by various psychologists from all over the world for centuries. On the basis of these studies and observations, psychologists articulated them as laws of human psychology, these laws were further carried forward as foundational laws for User Experience Design.</p>
         <p>Interestingly, we all have come across or at some point have experienced most of these laws in our lives or whilst interacting with various digital interfaces, we always knew how we perceive and analyze different experiences/interfaces and try to make sense of even the abstract ones. The Laws of UX just bring forward the articulated format of human psychology and perceptions. So let’s get started!

         <blockquote>
             <p>
                Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as a design that’s more usable.

         <p>I examined the Hero Page of Land Rover India, a luxury car manufacturing company. The minimalistic, clean and sober look and layout that the brand carries tell us more about the Brand and its products, making it look more authentic, reliable, strong and premium, it conveys all those emotions just by showcasing a simple, aesthetic and functional hero page!</p>
         <p>According to the Aesthetic-Usability Effect, an aesthetically good design creates a positive response in users’ brains and leads them to believe that the design actually works better.</p>
